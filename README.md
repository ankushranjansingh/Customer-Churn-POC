# Customer-Churn-POC

Churn prediction is one of the most  popular telecom use cases in business.  It consists of detecting customers who  are likely to cancel a subscription to a  service.
Churn is a problem for telecom  companies because it is more expensive  to acquire a new customer than to keep  your existing one from leaving.
